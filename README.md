# drum-machine aka Tactical Marine Soundboard

Soundboard built in React with Dawn of War tactical marine barks.

## Goals

Another of my pending fCC challenges that I'm using to mess around with Vite, Tailwind and Codeium. Instead of playing the suggested sounds clips, I got some Dawn of War barks so I can use this thing to annoy friends during calls.

## Conclusion

A simple but sort of time-consuming challenge. Made an extra effort to keep the CSS responsive using Tailwind so I could get more into it. Kept the code as DRY as possible.

Don't know if they've made significant changes to Codeium, but it has been the most helpful I've seen it so far. Code suggestions took context into consideration and spared me a lot of googling and typing. Still made mistakes, but nothing too hard to catch.
